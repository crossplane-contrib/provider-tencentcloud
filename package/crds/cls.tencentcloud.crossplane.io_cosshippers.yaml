                  reference fields. The fields that are in InitProvider are merged
                  into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same fields are
                  also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid updating
                  them after creation. This is useful for fields that are required
                  on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them,
                  like an autoscaler.
