                              Resolution specifies whether resolution of this reference is required.
                              The default is 'Required', which means the reconcile will fail if the
                              reference cannot be resolved. 'Optional' means this reference will be
                              a no-op if it cannot be resolved.

                              the corresponding field is not present. Use 'Always' to resolve the

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
